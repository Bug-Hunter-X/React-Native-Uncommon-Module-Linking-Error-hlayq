# React Native Uncommon Module Linking Error

This repository demonstrates a common issue in React Native development: errors arising from incorrectly linked or configured native modules.  The example uses a hypothetical module, but the principles apply to many third-party libraries.

## Problem

When integrating a native module (e.g., one providing platform-specific functionality), linking it correctly to your React Native project is crucial. Failure to do so results in runtime errors indicating that the module cannot be found or loaded.

## Solution

The solution involves verifying and correcting the linking process.  This might involve steps such as:

- Ensuring the native module is correctly installed.
- Running the appropriate linking commands (often provided by the module's documentation).
- Checking for any discrepancies in project configurations (e.g., Android's `build.gradle`, iOS's `Podfile`).
- Cleaning and rebuilding the project.

## How to reproduce

1. Clone this repository.
2. Attempt to run the application (the `bug.js` file). You will observe a runtime error.
3. Review the `bugSolution.js` file to see the corrected version and the steps taken to resolve the linking issue.  You can then modify `bug.js` to match the corrected version.
