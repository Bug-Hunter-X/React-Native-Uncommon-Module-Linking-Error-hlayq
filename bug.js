This error occurs when using a third-party library or native module that is not properly linked or configured within your React Native project.  The specific error message may vary depending on the library, but it often involves a failure to find or load the required native code.

```javascript
// Example using a hypothetical 'react-native-uncommon-module' library:
import UncommonModule from 'react-native-uncommon-module';

const MyComponent = () => {
  return (
    <View>
      <UncommonModule/>
    </View>
  );
};
```
