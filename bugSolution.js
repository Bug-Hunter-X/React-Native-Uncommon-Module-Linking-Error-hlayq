The solution involves ensuring that the 'react-native-uncommon-module' (or your specific native module) is properly linked.  This typically entails using the appropriate linking commands for your platform (Android and iOS).  The process depends heavily on the library, so always consult its documentation.

Here's a conceptual solution assuming you've already run `npm install react-native-uncommon-module`:

**Android:**

- Modify your `android/app/build.gradle` to include the necessary dependencies (refer to the module's documentation). 
- Run `./gradlew clean` and rebuild your application.

**iOS:**

- Ensure your Podfile includes the module (`pod 'react-native-uncommon-module'`).
- Run `pod install` in your iOS project directory.
- Clean and rebuild your application using Xcode.

```javascript
// bugSolution.js
import UncommonModule from 'react-native-uncommon-module'; // Assuming proper linking

const MyComponent = () => {
  return (
    <View>
      <UncommonModule/>
    </View>
  );
};
```

**Important Note:** The exact steps for linking may differ significantly depending on the third-party module.  Always refer to the library's specific instructions for guidance.
